# AutomuteUs plugin

This is an [Impostor Server](https://github.com/impostor/Impostor) plugin for managing the [AutomuteUs](https://github.com/denverquane/automuteus) discord bot


## TODOs
- [ ] Perform a minimal connection to the server (discord automuteus) as a single client (socketio session) for test
- [ ] Modify the server part (discord automuteus) to be able to change the state of multiple servers in a single socketio session
  - Use the secret key for secure communication between the plugin and the server with advanced features
